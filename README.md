## Client side vs Server side
The first screenshots shows the application with `client side` rendering. This means HTML is server from de client (browser) using JS. As you can see the performance is not that bad. It is a bit slower that the server side render. Mainly because of the DOM, because the amount of requests is less than the server side render.
